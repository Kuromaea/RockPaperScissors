**Check out my new game I whipped up using HTML, CSS & JavaScript!**

I put this together just before diving into my JavaScript training (as of January 30, 2024).

- Here's what I aimed to achieve:

1Ô∏è‚É£ I wanted to see how HTML, CSS & JS play together and get the hang of their teamwork.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Wrap my head around using JavaScript.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Bag myself a nifty little game project.

- Game theme: "Rock, Paper, Scissors"

*It's a simple game of "Rock, Paper, and Scissors" where you play by the rules laid out on the game interface.*

- Instruction:

Just click on the various game buttons (choices-btn) at the bottom of the page, and boom, the showdown begins instantly.

**After that, the computer proudly declares the winner! Ready, set, play!** üöÄ

- Coding:

So, my code is a bit of a snapshot of where I'm at right now. As a junior, I'm pushing myself to learn and grow, so go easy on me, ahah?

I'm doing my best to apply the lessons and exercises I've been tackling, sticking to coding etiquette like good naming conventions, clean code, and making things readable.

The CSS part? Well, that's a "code from scratch" situation. No real tweaks or optimizations just yet, but, I've got plans for some future fine-tuning. The HTML part? Keeping it simple and user-friendly, I reckon. And for the JavaScript bit, the whole game's concept was inspired straight from a FreeCodeCamp course (big shoutout to them!). I've put my own spin on it to match my style and how I want my game to look.

Got any feedback or suggestions? Feel free to drop them in! I'd love to hear your thoughts and have a good chat about it. Cheers! üöÄ
