**Rock, Paper & Scissors game: check out my new game I whipped up using HTML, CSS & JavaScript!**

# Introduction 🎞

## 1. Technologies 💻

- <code>HTML</code>
- <code>CSS</code>
- <code>JavaScript</code>

## 2. Coding goals ✨

I put this together just before diving into my JavaScript training (as of January 30, 2024).
Here's what I aimed to achieve:

**🤔 Understanding:**
 - I wanted to see how HTML, CSS and JS work together and understand their teamwork.

**🤓 Learning:**
 - To familiarise myself with the use of JavaScript.

**🎮 Game project:**
 - Make myself a nice little game project.
    
### 🔁 Reflections

I wanted to create a simple and not overly complex game to familiarize myself with JavaScript before my formal JS training. It was a challenge to grasp the interlocking elements and to assess whether my understanding was sufficient to accomplish this type of small game.
I discovered that the implementation of JavaScript involves different phases, such as initialization, declaration, and functions (containing events), which often operate in this manner. I began with HTML to define the skeleton of the game's various elements. Progressing directly to JavaScript, I implemented the game logic and concluded with CSS to add some styling to my game. The JavaScript part was carried out with the assistance of a tutorial available on YouTube, taught by FreeCodeCamp.

I also noticed that JavaScript bears resemblance to Dart (a language developed by Google for mobile development), which I had learned before undertaking my current web development training

## 3. Features 🛠

Here are the various features that I was able to add to the game:

- **<code>const getComputer = document.getElementById(#)</code>**
    - This is the initialization in JavaScript: Here, we reference the ID as elements present in the HTML (like a call).
- **<code>getChoices.forEach(choices => choices.addEventListener("click", (e) => {#}))</code>**
    - This is the declaration in JavaScript: We declare or rather listen here to the choice made by the user during the interaction with the game buttons.
- **<code>function generateComputerChoice() {#}</code>**
    - And finally, the functions & events in JavaScript: The functions will play the role of a "container," and the events of a "containing" using various available properties that will dynamically act to display or modify values.
- **Point important**
    - We also declare <code>.innerHTML</code> to effectively "mirror" the HTML and thus modify the declared value through the functions mentioned above.
    
### ⚒ Optimizations

- Update the JavaScript code according to the more current and less 'junior' naming conventions.
- Revise the CSS code, as it was implemented 'from scratch' without optimization or a global style sheet (CSS variables, etc.).
- Explore the addition of new features to the game or even incorporating other games in the form of a 'game website,' complete with a game selection navigation—something to consider.


## 4. Run and Debug ⚙

1. Download or clone it the **RockPaperScissors.zip** folder from the project and unzip it.
2. Open the **RockPaperScissors folder** with a code editor of your choice.
3. Launch the file <code>/RockPaperScissors/game-folder/index.html</code> in your browser locally (you can use extensions such as Live Server, Live Preview, etc.).
4. Read the game rules in the header.
5. Simply **click** on the various game buttons (choices-btn) at the bottom of the page, and boom, the showdown begins instantly.
   
> [!NOTE]
> It's a simple game of "Rock, Paper, and Scissors" where you play by the rules laid out on the game interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After that, the computer proudly declares the winner! Ready, set, play! 🚀
